# TDE3 - Collaborative Project

The objective of this work is to develop a contact analyzer from the Enron Email Dataset* database. This project seeks to explore a practical application of graph theory that allows extracting useful information from the contact network generated with the emails present in the database.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main file that runs the program.
- `functions/`: Directory containing helper functions used in the project.
- `lista_de_adjacencias.txt`: Input file representing the graph's adjacency list.
- `Amostra Enron - 2016/`: Directory containing sample data for testing.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeonardoChung/tde3-projetocolaborativo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tde3-projetocolaborativo
   ```

3. Run the main file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Make sure the file `lista_de_adjacencias.txt` is in the same directory or update the path in the code as needed.
